#SICCOM - Spatial Interaction in Coral Reef Communities

## Version 3.0 - Climate change drives trait-shifts in coral reef communities
The program allows the simulation of spatial dynamics in a benthic coral reef community under various environmental settings in monthly iterations. Several coral species, with either massive or branching colony growth morphologies are implemented as individual colonies, which compete for space with each other as well as with macroalgae.


Coral species can be parametrised with respect to different life history characteristics, such as growth, reproduction, competitive abilities and susceptibilities to environmental conditions, such as extreme temperature events.


Life history characteristics of macroalgae, such as reproduction, growth, maximum size and mortality can also be parametrised in configuration files.
